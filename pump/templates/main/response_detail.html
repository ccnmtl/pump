    <h1>My Summary</h1>

    <p>
        You identified yourself as a {{object.age}} year old {{object.sex}}
        with {{object.amputation_level}} amputation due to {{object.amputation_cause}}. Your
        responses indicate that your current walking ability is
        categorized as {{results.houghton.category}} ability. People with lower limb prostheses who have
        an independent community walking ability can usually walk at a
        speed of &gt;0.8 m/s; people who have an independent household
        walking ability but are limited in community walking usually
        can walk &gt;0.5 m/s.
